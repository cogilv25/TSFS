# Tech Stack From Scratch
The basic premise is to create everything from scratch (well the software at least, and we will slightly cheat by using nasm to start off). So first we will create an extremely basic bootloader, text editor and assembler, then we will use our assembler to assemble everything and from there on we will not use any external tools. We will then create a higher level language and the tools to write, compile and assemble it into machine code. We can then expand the complexity of our tools as well as start making an operating system to house them. We will need to make drivers here and there of course and probably do a bunch of things I haven't even thought of yet. The final aim is to create something unique and aimed at tinkerers rather than general users while learning a whole lot at the same time. Currently we are targetting x86, however, I am interested in moving to risc-v as long as I don't discover that it's a poor choice for my application..
